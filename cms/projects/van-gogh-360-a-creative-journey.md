f_way-of-work: Our design team began with thorough research into Van Gogh’s life
  and artistic style. We focused on his most iconic works, such as "Starry
  Night," "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom," to ensure that the posters would
  resonate with a wide audience. We used a color palette inspired by Van Gogh’s
  most famous works, incorporating vibrant blues, yellows, and greens. A blend
  of elegant serif fonts and bold, modern sans-serif fonts was used to balance
  the classic and contemporary elements of the exhibition. The event title “Van
  Gogh 360” was given prominence with a distinct, easily readable typeface. The
  layout was designed to guide the viewer’s eye from the central imagery to the
  essential event details, such as dates, venue, and ticket information.
  Balanced compositions with ample white space were used to prevent the posters
  from feeling cluttered.
